Project Setup / Installation:

* For MacOS:
    - Pull the latest changes from the `2022-12-15 - Final Project` directory in this repo
    - We included a makefile in the final project directory
    - In order to play game run `make run` in the terminal 
    - Make sure to manually add the SFML install directory in line 16 if the current one specified in the makefile doesn't run
* For Windows:
    - Clone the repository, Download the zip file or pull the latest changes from the `2022-12-15 - Final Project` directory in this repo
    - After pulling the repo make sure you have SFML 2.5.1 on your PATH
    - To run the program go into the `bin` directory in the `2022-12-15 - Final Project` directory and find the `SFMLGame.exe` program
    - Recommended that you open the VS solution and rebuild in release before running `SFMLGame.exe`
    - If an error occurs, re-clone repo
    - Click `SFMLGame.exe` to run it
    - If `SFMLGame.exe` does not run, rebuild by going into the Visual Studio directory and Clicking on the Solution file
    - Make sure to have some version of `Visual Studio` installed
    - Put the compiler in release mode and run the program
    - The main branch doesn't contain audio due to an unsolved exception in one of the group members computer
    - To get the version of the game with audio please pull the `sound` branch
    - If that branch doesn't run, use the `main` branch
    - Instructions are the same for both branches
